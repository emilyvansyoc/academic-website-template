## About 

I am a microbiome scientist and my primary research objective is to view human health through a holobiont perspective.  

I research microbiomes across contexts and have previously studied soils, animals, and humans. I'm interested in how pharmaceuticals alter the gut mycobiota (or vice versa), and understanding how the holobiont framework applies to our gut eukaryotic symbionts.

I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar in the Bordenstein Lab at Penn State University. Outside of science, I am passionate about fostering and adopting senior giant breed dogs, volunteering with an equine therapy barn, and knitting.
